#  __main.py__ (Python sample function)                   #

#  This sample code uses an external module "lorem"       #
#  to generate an arbitrary result message. IBM code      #
#  engine functions code with references to external      #
#  modules have to be deployed as code-bundles.           # 
#
#  This sample shows how to access URL parameters in a    #
#  function.                                              #
#                                                         #
#  This sample shows how an external reference is coded   #
#  in the source file (__main__.py) and how the modul     #
#  is referenced in the requirements.txt.                 #
#                                                         #
